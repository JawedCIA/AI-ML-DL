# IIT Kanpur Certificate Program on PYTHON for Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Introduction
Welcome to my collection of hands-on programming practices and projects, created during the IIT Kanpur Certification Program on Python for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). This repository serves as a personal archive of everything I've learned and built during this intensive 4-week program.

The program focused on practical applications of Python in AI, ML, and DL, using real-world datasets from various domains such as business, medicine, science, and engineering. It introduced me to powerful Python libraries and tools, including:
* NumPy
* linalg
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Keras
## Why This Repository?
This repository is a way for me to document and share my learning journey. It's packed with code snippets, projects, and solutions that I worked on throughout the program. My goal is to keep these resources organized and accessible for future reference and to help others who might find them useful.
